     An overview of the famous musicians who mysteriously died at 27 years old.<br>

This project provides an overview of the massive cultural phenomenon of the 27 Club and its members. It is quite well-known that the 27 Club includes all the popular artists who suddenly died at 27 years old, most of the time due to suicide, overdose or consequences related to the alcohol consumption or the use of drugs. As far as this project is concerned, we have provided an overview of the members of the 27 Club, but with a particular focus on musicians and singers.<br>

A sense of unease surrounds the history of the so-called 27 Club, mainly rockstars, who are united by a sudden and premature death. We all know the most famous of them: Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana who committed suicide, Jim Morrison, frontmain of The Doors who died of an overdose, as well as Amy Winehouse and Janis Joplin, Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix. But there are more of them. It would therefore be interesting to look into this creepy club, that has now turned into a cultural phenomenon, in order to know more about its members.<br>
