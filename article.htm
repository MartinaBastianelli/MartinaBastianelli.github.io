<h1>The 27 Club - Article</h1>

<p>As it is possible to read from the introduction and the paragraph of our Melody’s story, the 27 Club can be considered as one of the most tragic coincidences related to the sudden death of some famous and talented artists -including musicians, singers, painters, etc. – that soon became a cultural phenomenon in the history of music. 
Since this project focuses mainly on the singers of the 27 Club, it is possible to search for each one of them in our story’s text-search bar in order to discover their personal musical genre, their specific type of voice, their songs and albums and the other members of their bands, if they belonged to one (Img. 1; Img. 2; Img. 3).

<p>Our first map shows that the majority of the members – today there are 26 of them – comes from the United States of America and Northern Europe, in particular England, since these countries have always represented a fertile ground for the birth of new stars, thanks to the numerous recording companies they host. Just a small part of them comes from Russia and only one member comes from Oceania (Img. 4). With the second map, is then possible to see that the Club splits in two groups: those who died in the USA and those who died in Northern Europe, so probably, 
being all of them artists, they moved during their lives where they had more possibilities to be successful (Img. 5). </p>

<p>Then, the tables provide the personal details of some members: the first one tells their name, their date and place of birth and death and offers a picture of them (Img. 6); the second one lists the causes of the members’ deaths (Img. 7). We all know the most famous members (our story shows all of them, also lesser-known ones):   </p>
<p>•	Brian Jones (1942-1969), drowned;</p>
<p>•	Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970), dead from asphyxiation due to drug use;</p>
<p>•	Janis Joplin (1943-1970), dead from drug overdose;</p>
<p>•	 Jim Morrison (1943-1971), dead from heart failure;</p>
<p>•	Kurt Cobain (1967-1994), dead from suicide;</p>
<p>•	Amy Winehouse (1983-2011), dead from alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>The members’ causes of death testify that they all died suddenly and abruptly due to suicide, overdose or consequences related to the alcohol consumption or the use of drugs, which is quite common in the world of fame, in particular as far as rockstars living extreme lives is concerned.</p>

<p>The introduction of different charts in the stories allows to well represent the years in which the 27 Club members started their activity -the majority of them during the 1960s –  and ended it (Img. 8; Img. 9)), the ones of them that received awards - Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin in particular – (Img. 10) and the years in which they died (Img. 11). </p>

<p>This overview of the 27 Club and their members is essential in order to give a tribute to their music and to remember them as people, not only as the cultural phenomenon they have turned in. </p>
